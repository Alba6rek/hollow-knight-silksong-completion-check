## General info

Hollow Knight doesn't have a game completion list in-game. There is no way to easily check what specific things you forgot to do or missed for full 112% Game Completion, Hunter's Journal and Achievements. Until now! I wrote a tool for that for you.

*Inspirations: love for Hollow Knight, discussions on the forum, [KayDeeTee](https://github.com/KayDeeTee/Hollow-Knight-SaveManager) and [bloodorca](https://bloodorca.github.io/hollow)'s Save Editors, programming learning, Elderbug.*

## Steam Guide

More info with features and visual previews can be found in the official [Steam Guide](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2209910193) for the Tool.

## How to use

There are two ways to use this online tool:

1. **Simple way**: just choose your **user\*.dat** save file and see the magic happen! See [save game locations paragraph](#hollow-knight-save-game-locations) below on where to find your Hollow Knight save files.  
The tool doesn't have the power to modify *any* of your files, but *always* do backups just in case.

2. **Advanced way**: for people who wish to share saves on forums in text format through [pastebin.com](https://pastebin.com/). Step by step tutorial:

   * Use bloodorca's amazing [Online Save File Editor](https://bloodorca.github.io/hollow) to decode your Hollow Knight **user\*.dat** save file into text.

   * Left-click anywhere inside the text box in the Editor after decoding the save and press **CTRL+A** (or Right-click -> Select All). Only the text inside the text box (decoded save file contents) should be selected.
  
   * Press **CTRL+C** (or Right-click -> Copy) to copy the whole contents inside the text box.

   * Go to the [Tool's webpage](https://reznormichael.github.io/hollow-knight-completion-check/) and press **CTRL+V** (or Right-click -> Paste) to paste the copied text inside the text box.

   * Click **"Analyze Text"**. If the copy-pasted data was correct, you will see your Completion %, Play Time, and a whole list of things you have done (‚úÖ) or not yet done (‚ùå).

## Hollow Knight Save game locations

### Your Steam Cloud

If you have Steam Cloud enabled for Hollow Knight, you can download your save [directly from here.](https://store.steampowered.com/account/remotestorageapp/?appid=367520)  
You can use this if you want to check your save progress without access to your PC (on mobile/tablet for example) or if you don't want to search manually for the save files.

### Windows

`%USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow\Team Cherry\Hollow Knight\`  
**Pro Tip:** Copy and paste this code into the folder path bar of the Windows File Explorer window and press Enter to go there instantly (Windows 10).  
*Example path: C:\Users\your-username\AppData\LocalLow\Team Cherry\Hollow Knight*

### Linux

`~/.config/unity3d/Team Cherry/Hollow Knight/`

### macOS

`~/Library/Application Support/unity.Team Cherry.Hollow Knight/`

### Filenames

**user\*.dat** ‚Äî main save file. Where \* is a number between 1 and 4, and it is the appropriate save slot inside the game.  
**user\*.dat.bakX** ‚Äî backup save files. Where X is a number in ascending order meaning how many backups were made during the whole playthrough of that save. The higher the number, the more recent the backup. There are usually 3 save backups at one time, older backups are deleted.
